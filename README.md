While analyzing Citi Bike data for July 2014 and July 2024, I uncovered some interesting insights and trends. But cleaning and combining such a huge data also needed some Python touch. Please see details in jupyter files

Comparing Citi Bike usage in July 2014 and July 2024, several key trends emerge:
	
	- Rides jumped from 968K in 2014 to 4.7M in 2024 (5x increase)!

	- More Members Using Citi Bike 

	- Member rides grew from 850K to 3.6M, but in total rides non-member rides increased from 12.29% to 23.08%

	- Electric bikes took over classic ones almost on every popular drop-on station in 2024
      electric bikes had 3.1M rides, classic bikes had 1.6M.

	- Average trip time stayed the same 

	- the average ride was about 14 minutes in both years

	- Peak riding hours almost did not shifted. It is still 5-6PM

    - Leisure-based biking appears to be growing, as weekends are busier in 2024 compared to 2014

	- Holidays impact ridership, with the 4th of July consistently being the slowest day

    - End of the months - tendency to busiest rides
    

The Citi Bike program continues to evolve, with changing usage patterns over the years. The data suggests shifts in commuting habits, growing weekend usage, and increasing adoption of electric bikes in 2024.

And we see that statistics and stations are slightly different and diversity between end stations is wider
